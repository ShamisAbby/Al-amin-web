                FUNDING FOR ORPHANS EDUCATION AND HEALTH
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most important things we give priority to in our charity is education and health for orphans that we have registered in our office.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we are aware of the difficulties a child goes through who has lost a parent especially a father in accessing school education as well as health.
              </p>
              <p>
                In view of this, Al AMIN FOUNDATION has deliberately decided to provide them with the service so that they can feel as comfortable as other children.
              </p>
              <p>
                So our brother and sisters we ask you to donate everything you have to provide these orphans every month with the costs of * EDUCATION AND HEALTH *.

              <p>
                In the society in which we live there must be different groups of people.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are those who are often confronted with a large group of people who all grow up dependent on one person 
                and do not be surprised if the person who is dependent does not have any work to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We Al.amin are visiting a lot of urban and rural areas and saw this, so now we have the way  on how we can help those communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do a lot of work that can help them directly.

              <h3>Installing water pumps</h3>
              <p>
                It is well-known that all living things on earth need clean and safe water.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is an indisputable fact that despite the importance of water for biodiversity, 
                the water crisis has become chronic, especially in many African countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                And the society that suffers from water stress are children, the elderly and women who are 
                forced to pursue these needs farther and farther away again.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an effort to ensure that we eradicate global water scarcity, Al.amin foundation has grown 
                to provide drilling services to the community to facilitate access to this vital service
              </p>
              <p>
                Our foundation digs wells that are growing with national quality and standards to ensure it grows comfort in the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                These drilling services are supported by a very large amount and financial contribution you 
                our brother so we ask you to help our community in this by providing your support to the 
                Al.amin foundation.
              </p>
              <p>
                We usually drill two types of wells namely (hand wells) and (machine wells) in two completely different costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                You join us in this to satisfy and quench the thirst of our community members.

              <h3>Helping Disability people</h3>
              <p>
                It is not uncommon for large African societies to hide people with disabilities inside and see
                if the presence of children is a mistake in their lives something that just keeps them inside 
                without even involving them in social events. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In a State in which AL.  Amin does not agree with some of the parents.
              </p>
              <p>
                We support alternatives that can help a person with a disability to participate in social events.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The items are wheelchair, sunglasses, walking shoes, walking sticks e.t.c. 
              </p>

              <p>
                In the African societies in which we live there are economic conditions in different groups of people.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are those whose circumstances are better where they send their children to paid schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                And there are also those whose situation is very poor and a large group of community members, 
                their children are sent to government schools where according to the government policy of 
                Zanzibar education is free.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the fact that education is provided free of charge by the government but many families
                have their children unable to go to school for various reasons including:
              </p>
              <p>
                a) The distance from schools and community residences depending on the condition of the children is still very small.
              </p>
              <p>
                b) Shortage of science teachers.
              </p>
              <p>
                c) Lack of laboratory equipment for science students.
              </p>
              <p>
                d) Lack of textbooks in school libraries
              </p>
              <p>
                e) Lack of study materials such as handbags, pencils, shoes, and even textbooks for beginners.
              </p>
              <p>
                f) lack of sitting benchs for many schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                We Al.amin visit many urban and rural areas to see how we can help our communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also support a wide range of equipment according to current needs and those that are most important.

              <h3>Women Capital Empowering (widows)</h3>
              <p>
                In African societies, seeing a woman doing menial and compulsory work while having a baby is rare.
                This is due to the large community and women being abandoned by their husbands and giving them a very difficult time in their lives.
                In such a situation the Al.amin foundation does not like to see mothers experience such problems.
                So we decided to give them the capital they needed to start their own business.
                It is a group of women who are experiencing this affliction.

                There is a challenge for people to lack quality food depending on their living conditions.
                The Al.amin foundation is growing with a wide range of local and international food collection programs.
                So you are asked to provide your growing support in making sure this goes as we do.

                Everyone needs to be healthy or guaranteed to have that good health. 
                In an unusual situation, a large community of people in Zanzibar and Tanzania in general are not sure of their treatment in modern hospitals.
                AL.  Amin foundation plans to provide health insurance for disadvantaged communities The high cost of health care the people we need to help are orphans, the elderly, the disabled and widows.
                To accomplish this we need your financial contribution to be able to fulfill it.

              <p>
                Many people with low status go to government hospitals where they are available for cheaper treatment.  
                There are times when the hospital is overcrowded due to the need for more people something that leads to some of the important things in the hospital running out.  
                The Al.amin foundation usually supports medical equipment in the hospital in order to develop the humanitarian movement. 
                You can help us on this side of the hospital equipment.
